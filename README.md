# React Complete Guide

This repository is for tracking all coding done while completing the Udemy course: [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://discover.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

Contrary to normal branching strategy, each branch will represent the code at different points in time during the completion of the course. The 'main' branch will simply hold a fresh create-react-app for easy starting from scratch where necessary. For example, when doing assignments like the one at the end of Section 3. The other branches will be named for the code I have created at the end of each Section. Some sections may be built on code created in previous sections, so new branches will be created at that time using the previous branch as a base instead of main.

Below is a list of topics each section covers:
* Section 1: Getting Started
* Section 2: Refreshing Next Generation JavaScript (Optional)
* Section 3: Understanding the Base Features & Syntax
* Section 4: Working with Lists and Conditionals
* Section 5: Styling React Components & Elements
* Section 6: Debugging React Apps
* Section 7: Diving Deeper into Components & React Internals
* Section 8: A Real App: The Burger Builder (Basic Version)
* Section 9: Reach out to the Web (Http / Ajax)
* Section 10: Burger Builder Project: Accessing a Server
* Section 11: Multi-Page-Feeling in a Singl-Page-App: Routing
* Section 12: Adding Routing to our Burger Project
* Section 13: Forms and Form Validation
* Section 14: Redux
* Section 15: Adding Redux to our Project
* Section 16: Redux Advanced
* Section 17: Redux Advanced: Burger Project
* Section 18: Adding Authentication to our Burger Project
* Section 19: Improving our Burger Project
* Section 20: Testing
* Section 21: Deploying the App to the Web
* Section 22: Bonus: Working with Webpack

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
